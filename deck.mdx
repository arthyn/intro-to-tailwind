# What is Tailwind?

<Steps>

- just CSS
- plus a design system
- looks like `class="py-4 text-red-600"`

</Steps>

<Notes>

- just CSS
    - utility css framework
    - sits on top of current *CSS* setup, parsed by postcss
    - set of classes built from config
- design system
    - well designed system of theming values which enables building cohesive designs
- Verbose HTML (which makes it not as pretty)

</Notes>

# What Tailwind Isn't

<Steps>

- magic
- the solution to all your problems
- the solution for every CSS project
- the only way to do CSS
- only for tech "bros"

</Steps>

# Utility CSS?

```css
.flex {
    display: flex;
}

.py-4 {
    padding-top: 1rem;
    padding-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

<Notes>

- a framework which uses single classes almost exclusively to apply single CSS properties to an element. 
- We group repeated classes together with either a component or a component class.
- component classes are placed before utilities so that they are easily overidden, preventing specificity wars.

</Notes>

# Composing Classes

```css
.button {
    @apply flex items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-black text-white;
}
```

or through components
